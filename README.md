Personal code style and build tooling guidelines

## General Guidelines

* Follow the style guidelines by a project over these styles and don't fight a war over it please
* Coding style is just a suggestion. You're allowed to break it
* I'll often have a special reason that I note for why the guideline exists
	- It's often for the reason of portability, debuggability, or optimality of run/compile time when making debug builds
	- Very rarely will the reason be readability, enforcement, or maintenance
	- I find the former to be more tangible than the latter, hence why they have their priorities

## Specific Guidelines

* [C](./C.md)
* [CPP](./CPP.md)
